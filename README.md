gpc is a multipurpose ready to use web and admin stucture. You can easily download and start your website today with a powerful admin panel.

In this project child represents the website, parent represents admin panel for website and grand represents admin panel for parent.

so grand controls parent and parent controls child

Site and admin structures has their own read.me files in their folders. 

To start with gpc just click to download related folder and create a database for it in your phpmyadmin. Connect website with that database under your localhost. That's it! Now, you have a website with an admin panel.

FN: Don't forget that grand, parent and child have their own databases. Hence, you should create two databases for them.
